	 <div class="relative1">
	relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties.
		<div class="relative2">
		Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element. </div>

 <div class="relative">

This element is relatively-positioned. If this element was position: static; its absolutely-positioned child would escape and would be positioned relative to the document body.
	<div class="absolute">

	This element is absolutely-positioned. It's positioned relative to its parent.
